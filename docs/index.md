## 🏆 Final Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple:** Get basic features working first, then add enhancements
2. **Test Frequently:** Don't wait till the end to test your application
3. **Document as You Go:** Write README sections as you complete features
4. **Manage Time:** Allocate 2-3 hours for video creation and final testing
5. **Ask for Help:** Don't hesitate to reach out to mentors
6. **Focus on Learning:** This is about growth, not just winning
7. **Sleep:** A 2-hour power nap is better than buggy code from exhaustion
8. **Have Fun:** Enjoy the process and learn from others!

**Good luck, and happy hacking! 🚀**

*Remember: The goal is not just to build a project, but to learn, experiment, and push your boundaries. Every line of code you write is a step forward in your journey.*
