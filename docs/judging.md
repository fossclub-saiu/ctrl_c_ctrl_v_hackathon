# Judging Criteria

Projects are evaluated differently based on the level of difficulty. Here's how your project will be judged at each level.

---

## Level 1: First Year Students

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Functionality & Correctness** | 40% | Does the application work as intended? Are core features implemented? Are there major bugs? |
| **Logic & Code Quality** | 30% | Is the code clean and readable? Are data structures used appropriately? Is there proper error handling? |
| **User Interface & Experience** | 15% | Is the UI intuitive? Is it responsive? Does it provide good user feedback? |
| **Video Presentation** | 15% | Is the problem clearly explained? Is the demo effective? Are technical decisions justified? |

### Key Focus Areas for Level 1

- [x] Complete working application
- [x] Clean, understandable code
- [x] Basic features fully functional
- [x] Clear demonstration of learning

---

## Level 2: Second Year Students

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Functionality & Correctness** | 35% | Are all major features working? Is the application stable? |
| **Technical Implementation** | 30% | Quality of database design, API integration, algorithms used. Is AI integration meaningful? |
| **Innovation & Features** | 20% | Creative solutions? Additional features beyond requirements? |
| **Video Presentation** | 15% | Technical depth in explanation, clear architecture overview |

### Key Focus Areas for Level 2

- [x] Multi-module integration
- [x] Proper database design with relationships
- [x] Meaningful AI/ML usage (not just for show)
- [x] System thinking and architecture

### Penalties (Level 2)

| Issue | Penalty |
|-------|---------|
| Over-reliance on AI-generated code without understanding | -10% |
| Poor database design (no normalization, bad relationships) | -10% |
| Hardcoded values instead of configuration | -5% |

---

## Level 3: Third Year Students

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Functionality & Correctness** | 30% | Complete working system with all core features |
| **Technical Depth** | 30% | Advanced implementation, security considerations, algorithms, ML/NLP quality |
| **Scalability & Architecture** | 20% | System design quality, performance optimization, code organization |
| **Innovation & Impact** | 20% | Novel approaches, real-world applicability, production-readiness |

### Key Focus Areas for Level 3

- [x] Advanced technical concepts (real-time, security, NLP)
- [x] Production-ready code quality
- [x] Scalable architecture
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and edge cases
- [x] Security best practices

### Bonus Points (Level 3)

| Achievement | Bonus |
|-------------|-------|
| 🌟 Deployed/hosted application | +5% |
| 🌟 Comprehensive test coverage | +5% |
| 🌟 API documentation (Swagger/Postman) | +3% |
| 🌟 CI/CD pipeline | +3% |
| 🌟 Exceptional UI/UX | +5% |

### Penalties (Level 3)

| Issue | Penalty |
|-------|---------|
| ⚠️ Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.) | -15% |
| ⚠️ No error handling | -10% |
| ⚠️ Hardcoded credentials | -10% |
| ⚠️ Copied code without attribution | -20% |

## Video Presentation Guidelines

!!! tip "What Makes a Good Video"
    - **Be concise:** Stay within the 5-minute limit
    - **Show, don't tell:** Demonstrate working features
    - **Explain decisions:** Why did you choose this approach?
    - **Be technical:** Judges want to see your understanding

!!! warning "What to Avoid"
    - Long introductions
    - Reading from a script robotically
    - Not showing actual working demo
    - Spending too much time on slides instead of demo

### Recommended Video Structure

| Section | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Problem Overview | 30 seconds | What problem are you solving? |
| Solution Demo | 2-3 minutes | Live demonstration of your application |
| Technical Explanation | 1-2 minutes | Key features, technologies, challenges, architecture |
