# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about the hackathon, answered.

---

## AI & Tools

### Q1: Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot?

**Yes, but with understanding.**

Using AI for code suggestions is allowed, but you must understand every line of code you submit. Blind copy-paste without understanding will be penalized during evaluation.

!!! tip "Best Practice"
    Use AI tools to learn and understand concepts, not just to generate code. You should be able to explain any part of your code if asked.

---

## Deployment

### Q2: Do I need to deploy my application?

**Not mandatory, but highly recommended.**

Deployed applications receive bonus points and show initiative. It also makes it easier for judges to test your application.

**Recommended platforms:**

| Type | Platforms |
|------|-----------|
| Frontend | Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages |
| Backend | Railway, Render, Heroku |
| Full-stack | Vercel, Railway |
| Databases | MongoDB Atlas, PlanetScale, Supabase |

---

## Libraries & Frameworks

### Q3: Can I use existing libraries and frameworks?

**Yes!** Use frameworks and libraries freely. However, core business logic should be your own.

| Allowed | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| UI libraries | React, Vue, Bootstrap, Tailwind |
| Backend frameworks | Express, Flask, Django |
| Database ORMs | Prisma, SQLAlchemy, Mongoose |
| Utility libraries | Lodash, Moment.js, NumPy |

!!! warning "What Should Be Your Own"
    The matching algorithm, recommendation logic, or core business rules should be your implementation, not copied from tutorials.

---

## Completion

### Q4: What if I don't finish all features?

**Focus on making core features work perfectly** rather than having many half-working features.

A smaller, polished project scores better than an incomplete ambitious one.

!!! tip "MVP Approach"
    1. Identify the 3-4 most important features
    2. Build them completely
    3. Test thoroughly
    4. Add more features if time permits

---

## Templates & Boilerplates

### Q5: Can I use pre-built templates or boilerplates?

| Level | Policy |
|-------|--------|
| Level 1 | Templates and boilerplates allowed |
| Level 2 | Templates and boilerplates allowed |
| Level 3 | More original architecture expected |

!!! info "Credit Your Sources"
    Always credit where you got templates or starter code from in your README.

---

## Video Presentation

### Q6: How will the video be evaluated?

Videos should be **clear, concise, and technical**.

**Focus on:**

- What problem you're solving
- How you solved it technically
- Challenges you faced
- Key technical decisions

**Avoid:**

- Long introductions
- Reading from script robotically
- Not showing actual working demo
- Excessive slides instead of demo

---

## Programming Languages

### Q7: What programming language should I use?

**Use whatever you're comfortable with** or want to learn.

| Language | Good For |
|----------|----------|
| Python | Rapid development, ML/AI, data processing |
| JavaScript | Web apps, full-stack, real-time features |
| TypeScript | Type safety, larger projects |
| Java | Enterprise applications, Android |
| Go | High performance, APIs |
| Rust | Systems programming, security |

!!! tip "Recommendation"
    Python and JavaScript are popular for rapid development, but any language is acceptable.

---

## Level Selection

### Q8: Can I work on a problem from a lower level?

| Your Year | Can Attempt |
|-----------|-------------|
| First Year | Level 1, 2, or 3 |
| Second Year | Level 2 or 3 |
| Third Year | Level 3 only |

Choose based on your comfort and learning goals. First years are encouraged to challenge themselves with higher levels if they're confident!

---

## Open Innovation

### Q9: What if my idea for Open Innovation is too ambitious?

**Scope it down to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** that demonstrates the core concept.

It's better to have a working simple version than an incomplete complex one.

**How to scope down:**

1. Identify the ONE core feature that defines your project
2. Build that feature completely
3. Add supporting features only if time permits
4. Document what you would build with more time

---

## UI/UX

### Q10: How important is UI/UX?

| Level | UI/UX Weight |
|-------|--------------|
| Level 1 | 15% (moderately important) |
| Level 2 | Less weight but still matters |
| Level 3 | Less weight but still matters |

**A clean, functional UI is preferred over fancy animations.**

!!! tip "UI Priorities"
    1. Functionality first - does it work?
    2. Usability - can users figure it out?
    3. Aesthetics - does it look professional?

## Quick Tips Recap

1. **Start Simple:** Get basic features working first, then add enhancements
2. **Test Frequently:** Don't wait till the end to test your application
3. **Document as You Go:** Write README sections as you complete features
4. **Manage Time:** Allocate 2-3 hours for video creation and final testing
5. **Ask for Help:** Don't hesitate to reach out to mentors
6. **Focus on Learning:** This is about growth, not just winning
7. **Sleep:** A 2-hour power nap is better than buggy code from exhaustion
8. **Have Fun:** Enjoy the process and learn from others!
